# 🌌 Star Wars Feature Selection Page

A visually immersive **Star Wars–themed feature selector** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project reimagines a simple feature selection interface as a galactic control panel complete with glowing neon checkboxes, background music, and lightsaber sound effects.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Feature Selection Page** allows users to toggle different “features” represented as checkboxes — such as *Force Mode* or *Hyperdrive*.  
When a checkbox is activated, it glows like a lightsaber, plays activation sounds, and changes color dynamically.

This project fulfills the required user stories and adds an engaging Star Wars twist with:
- Custom checkbox styling using CSS
- Background music
- Lightsaber on/off sound effects
- Animated starfield background

## 🧩 User Stories

✅ **Your page should have:**
1. An `h1` element with the text **Feature Selection**.  
2. A `div` element with the class **feature-card-container**.  
3. At least **two label elements** with the class **feature-card** inside `.feature-card-container`.  
4. Each label should include **label text** and an **input** of type **checkbox**.  
5. All checkboxes are styled with `appearance: none;`, a visible border, and color transitions.  
6. Checked boxes display a **checkmark (✓)** and change background + border color.  
7. Bonus: Star Wars–themed music and animated background.
